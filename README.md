==========

Opensourced tweaks, do not steal my work, if you wish to modify it and upload it, please contact me first.

TCPLight - Turns on your TCP lighting system via a curl request.
It is in the works currently, beta should be out soon.


ShuffleLock - Shuffles the lockscreen "slide to unlock" text. It is working has a few bugs, its not tested for iOS8.
Will resume once I have the motivation.

RemindMeAnywhere - My first tweak, dont even bother looking at it, its hideous.
